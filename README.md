### Client application for the ReInform project

# Inspiriation

### In a world inundated with misinformation and fake news, the quest for truth has become increasingly challenging. Inspired by the pressing need to combat the spread of false information, our team embarked on a journey to develop an innovative solution: a misinformation-detecting app. With a mission to empower users with accurate information, our project aims to foster critical thinking and promote digital literacy in an era where truth is often obscured by falsehoods.

# Build Process

### Throughout building this app our group encountered numerous difficult challenges to provide our users with easy-to-access accurate information. There was two big challenges that we had to overcome, the UI and the Server to connect the app to. The UI required a lot of development and growth from our coders since the utilization of Flutter and Dart to implement a professional and clean interface for our users. The server was another large challenge since technology often does not like to do what you ask every time. As such creating the link between our Flutter application and the server to return the responses from provided an adequate challenge for the group.
